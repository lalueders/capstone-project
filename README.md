# MyNotes App
Capstone Project from the Web Development Bootcamp at [neueFische](https://www.neuefische.de/weiterbildung/web-development) üê†

## About:
From once-in-a-lifetime events to everyday moments. MyNotes offers you the possibility Keep your memories save in one private digital place! For this purpose, you have a complete create and edit mode for your entries, which also includes the possibility for uploading photos. If you enable geolocation in your device settings, your location will be automatically added to each entry. How convenient is that! Of course, you can also edit your location manually. To make it easy for you to navigate through your memories, you can use a full text search to find individual notes. Or you can use different filters to sort your notes by categories. Possibilities are endless, because you can create new categories yourself and use them as filters too.
